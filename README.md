Regression models describe relationship between a dependent variable and independent variable(s).
We will use simple linear regression to predict the price of a car based on its mileage.

A Gradient descent will help us to find values of parameters of a function that minimizes a cost function.
In this case, it will be the mean squared error function.

# Mean squared error function (the slammer MSE value is, the better predictions will be)

Make sure to download python3, combined with libraries csv, matplotlib and numpy to be able to compile.

Have fun 😄
